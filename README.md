# W3Resource - Purescript

[Purescript](https://www.purescript.org/) is a `purely-functional language` that inspired by [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) and [Javascript or ECMAScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/).

[W3Resource](https://www.w3resource.com/) is a website that teach and test ones ability regarding syntax, understanding of the fundamental of programming, and algorithms.

And in this repository contains `my way of solving problems` that provided by [W3Resource](https://www.w3resource.com/) titled [C Basic Algorithm: Exercise, Practice, Solution](https://www.w3resource.com/c-programming-exercises/basic-algo/index.php) using purely-funtional language purescript.

## Getting started

Before you can run [Purescript](https://www.purescript.org), you need to make sure that you have [nodejs](https://www.nodejs.org) installed on your local machine.

After that you can follow this [instruction](https://github.com/purescript/documentation/blob/master/guides/Getting-Started.md) to run purescript.

For testing purpose you also need to install [`pulp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pulp/v/3.2.2) and [`bower`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bower) then you need to add all dependencies, to do so just follow these simple steps:

* Install `pulp` using `npm install -g pulp`
* Then install `bower` using `npm install -g bower`
* After that you can install dependencies using `bower install`
* And finally you can build using `pulp build` or run the tests unit using `pulp test`
